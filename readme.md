# HTML/CSS Resume Project

This project contains personalized and customizable HTML/CSS resumes tailored for web development and software development roles.

## Project Overview

The project includes two versions of the resume:

- **Web Development Resume**: Designed for web development job applications.
- **Software Development Resume**: Tailored for software development or Python-based job applications.

Each resume version consists of two pages:

1. Introduction and summary of qualifications.
2. Detailed work experience, skills, and education.

## Accessing the Resumes

You can access the resumes online through the following links:

- [Web Development Resume](https://ankitjha2603.github.io/resume/web/)
- [Software Development Resume](https://ankitjha2603.github.io/resume/software/)

To focus on a specific page, you can use the `page-number` parameter. For example:

- [https://ankitjha2603.github.io/resume/software?page-number=2](https://ankitjha2603.github.io/resume/software?page-number=2)

## Why HTML/CSS?

I chose to create the resumes using HTML and CSS for several reasons:

1. **Customization**: HTML and CSS offer a high level of customization, allowing for unique and visually appealing resume designs. This level of customization ensures that each resume stands out and reflects the individual's personality and skills.

2. **Interactive Elements**: With HTML and CSS, I can incorporate interactive elements such as hyperlinks, hover effects, and animations, enhancing the user experience and engagement with the content.

3. **Accessibility**: By hosting the resumes online, they are easily accessible to potential employers and recruiters. Additionally, using HTML/CSS allows for optimization for accessibility standards, ensuring that the resumes are inclusive and accessible to all users.

4. **Version Control and Collaboration**: GitHub provides version control and collaboration features, making it easy to manage changes, track revisions, and collaborate with others on the resumes.

5. **Compatibility with Web Technologies**: As the job market increasingly relies on web-based platforms for recruitment and hiring, presenting resumes in HTML/CSS format demonstrates proficiency in web technologies, which may be advantageous for roles in web development or software engineering.

By leveraging HTML and CSS, I aim to create visually appealing, interactive, and accessible resumes that effectively communicate my qualifications and expertise to potential employers.
